This is a short and simple Javascript script that uses Regex on a supplied log file in order to find Normal Mode Tables. These Tables are then processed by 1. First, converting `center numbers` to `atom symbols`. This is done by using an array of element symbols in order of atomic number and using another table within the log file for `center number` to `atomic number` mappings.    Then, merging rows with the same mode and atoms (up to the first 3 positions of their definitons)     1. here, the `relative weights` of the matching rows are summed    2. we also catalogue the names of all merged rows in order to support observing what rows were merged to produce each process row. 2. We print out that new processed tables.
